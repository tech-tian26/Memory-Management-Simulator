-> Allocated block always stored in free space
-> No overlapping allocated segments
-> After freeing blocks, adjacent memory coalesced (non-buddy) or merged (buddy)
-> Stats reflect:
   - Total Memory = free + used
   - Success Rate = successes / total requests
-> Buddy always allocates power-of-2 blocks
-> Cache hit must avoid VM access
-> Virtual access must go:
    VA → Page Table → Frame → Cache → Memory
